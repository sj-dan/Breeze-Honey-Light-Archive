# Instructions
In order to install this file to KDE, you need to do the following.

1. Clone this GitHub repo (either just via `git clone https://github.com/sj-dan/Breeze-Honey-Light-Archive` or by clicking on the Download as ZIP button on GitHub.
2. Go to ~/.local/share, and use your brain to know where to extract the files from the **local/share** folder in the GitHub repo. Make sure to extract **share** into **local**, so that it asks "Do you want to write into this folder?".
3. Open System Settings in KDE, and go to Appearance -> Global Themes, and just select Breeze-Honey-Light. From there, it's up to you which Aurorae (Title bar) theme you want to use, as there are 2 included with the theme.
